# 👋 Hi, I'm David Chung!

✨ Full-stack learner • Creative builder • Startup-minded developer ✨  
I love bringing ideas to life — from small weekend hacks to full-blown prototypes.  
Coding for me isn’t just about syntax — it’s about **turning imagination into something real and shareable.**

---

## 🚀 What I’m Passionate About
- Building **AI tools and backend APIs**
- Experimenting with **Redis**, **PHP**, and **Jenkins**
- Learning how to connect every layer of web development (frontend ↔ backend ↔ infra)
- Sharing knowledge and collaborating with other curious minds 💡
